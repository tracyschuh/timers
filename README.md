# timers
This application consists of a stopwatch and countdown timer. Only one option can run at a time, so the user makes a selection and the appropriate time is dynamically updated. I included a fun sound at the end of the countdown timer so the user knows that time's up. I've also included an animated header for interest.

A live demo can be found <a href="https://tracyschuh.com/timers/timers.html">here</a>.
